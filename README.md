## Use cases

## Technology stack:
1. NestJs + Typescript
2. MongoDB + Mongoose
3. Auth: - (3rd party)
4. Linter: airbnb

We have chosen these technologies because we want to learn them more and write an application with TypeScript which allows to make code with less number of bugs and makes development faster.
